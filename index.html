      <p class="directions">The Questions game is a fun game to play with a big group of people, you need to be standing in a circle and make sure you can see everyone. The first person to go points to a person and asks them a question, the person does not respond and either asks that person a question back or asks another person a question. This goes on until someone accidentally answers the question, someone hesitates or someone doesn't clearly point to the person they're asking the question to.</p>
